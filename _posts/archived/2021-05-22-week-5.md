"Just call a guy" is probably a frequently coined phrase at your average household. This week was mostly focused on maintenance of current projects, and I was ***that*** guy. It was also very turbulent for Crypto which saw a steady decline in value (thanks, Elon), nonetheless I went to the moon. While I was up there I remembered I forgot to close the backdoor after I left.<!--more-->

### 1. Just call a guy

Every now and then, things break. It mostly happens when you really need them or at a very inconvenient time. This week is spent the majority of my time staring at my IDE and burried 7 functions deep in WinDbg. It was great.

While I continued development of my [Beacon Object Files](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon-object-files), I decided to create one master script that would handle the user interface integration, payload creation and encoding, obfuscation and more. The concept is based on [StayKit](https://github.com/0xthirteen/StayKit), a persistence kit for Cobalt Strike which uses .NET assembly under the hood. I have dubbed it the [PeloponneseanWarKit]() because let's be honest, it sounds better than "StayKit".

The overall concept is quite simple.
* The script maintains a global set of defaults for common parameters and payload creation, which can be updated dynamically
* It hooks into the Cobalt Strike user interface and dynamically implements dialogs and menu items for the different Beacon Object Files
* It dynamically handles payload generation if desired
* It handles payload encoding and obfuscation using XOR encryption and base64 encoding
* It packs all the required arguments using `bof_pack()` so the target BOF can unpack them

The benefits of this approach are ease of use, easy to extend and contribute, avoid reuse of code and a solid base structure to build on top.

With the new concept worked out, I had to port over the functionality of my old scripts, which didn't come without issues. The greatest thing about Cobalt Strike's [Aggressor Script](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/index.html) is definitely not its packing API.

Cobalt Strike uses the `bof_pack()` function to pack arguments into a binary structure, so Beacon's BOF API can unpack them again. It is (supposedly) an easy way to pass user input to a Beacon Object File. `bof_pack()` supports different packing types:

|Type|Description|Unpack With (C)|
|---|---|---|
|b|binary data|BeaconDataExtract|
|i|4-byte integer|BeaconDataInt|
|s|2-byte short integer|BeaconDataShort|
|z|zero-terminated+encoded string|BeaconDataExtract|
|Z|zero-terminated wide-char string|(wchar_t*)BeaconDataExtract|

Most of the userdata I had to pack were simple strings so `z` was sufficient, the same goes with integer parameters where `i` would suffice and Beacon wouldn't have any issues unpacking the arguments. Since payloads are base64 encoded and then XOR encrypted I can either pack them as binary data or as a string, both work fine. To decrypt and decode the payload, Beacon only needs the size (length) of the data which can be retrieved with `BeaconDataExtract(&parser, &size)`. However I quickly ran into issues when packing wide-chars (wchar_t).

A wide character, or in C/C++ `wchar_t`, is UTF-16 little-endian encoded on Windows. This is double the size of a regular UTF-8 8-bit character. To use **RegKeyPersist**, which I will discuss later, I needed to pass some user arguments as wide character strings to Beacon. I used `bof_pack("Z")` to pack the data. To unpack the data I used the following code:

```c
datap parser;
BeaconDataParse(&parser, args, alen);
wchar_t* arg = (wchar_t*)BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);
```

This resulted in a **NTSTATUS** STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT (0x80000002) when I tried to use `arg` in an API call. Strange. In the end I had to resort to packing the arguments as regular strings with `z` and using Beacon's `toWideChar()` function to convert to a wide-char.

```c
datap parser;
BeaconDataParse(&parser, args, alen);
char* buff = BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);
// convert from char* to wchar_t*
wchar_t arg[100];
toWideChar(buff, arg, 100);
```

When I decided on payload management, I figured it would be good to add base64 encoding on top of the 1 byte XOR encryption I was already using. This would add a number of benefits:
* decreased payload size
* no plain XOR'd binary data going over the network
* no plain base64 going over the network

This means I had to implement base64 decoding in my Beacon Object Files. I found a great [base64 decoding routine](http://web.mit.edu/freebsd/head/contrib/wpa/src/utils/base64.c) from the [FreeBSD project](https://www.freebsd.org/) by [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), however I'm currently still running into issues when parsing the payload size after decoding.

### 2. To the moon!

In the midst of it all, I updated [DomainBorrowingC2](https://github.com/Cerbersec/DomainBorrowingC2) to bypass CDN caching and be a little less noisy by reducing the frequency of callbacks. It's now fully working and supports tasks. I'm planning on integrating it with the [PeloponneseanWarKit]() and write a C/C++ client that can be spawned with a Beacon Object File.

Unlike Crypto, it gained quite some traction in the infosec community since I released it publicly. After internal discussion with [NVISO](https://www.nviso.eu/) it has been decided the public version will remain available and will receive future updates and enhancements.

Back to our regular scheduled program!

### 3. Inviting myself to the party

This week I decided to take a break from process injection and take a look at persistence, because afterall, what's more fun than letting yourself in uninvited, or should I say self-invited :)

Similar to my process injection shenanigans, I wrote a Beacon Object File that uses direct syscalls to plant a registry key. There are 4 main registry keys that can be used to achieve persistence depending on the context.

Non-elevated: will only run when the current user logs on
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

Elevated: will run anytime the system boots
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

Creating a registry key is surprisingly easy, it only takes 3 steps:
* Obtain a handle to the target key with `NtOpenKey()`
* Write a new key-value pair with the payload using `NtSetValueKey()`
* Cleaning up the mess with `NtClose()`

To obtain a handle, `NtOpenKey()` requires 2 parts of the target registry key: the **root key** and the **subkey**. There are a total of 7 root keys, they all start with the **HKEY** prefix. We're interested in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) and HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU). 

As mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/registry-key-object-routines) these root keys are global handles. Some of them also have a corresponding object name starting with **\\Registry** which can be used to access the handle from kernel-mode. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is an exception, it does not have an object name, so we cannot directly use it with `NtOpenKey()`. This is because under the hood, HKCU looks like **\\Registry\\User\\\<user-sid>**. We can resolve this issue by calling `RtlOpenCurrentUser()` which will give us the full root key.

Once a handle is obtained, a new key-value pair can be written to the target registry key with `NtSetValueKey()`. It is possible to create a *hidden* key by preprending two nullbytes in front of the key name as outlined in [this whitepaper](https://github.com/ewhitehats/InvisiblePersistence/blob/master/InvisibleRegValues_Whitepaper.pdf).

```c
UNICODE_STRING valueName;
valueName.Buffer = L"\0\0WinRegKeyName";
valueName.Length = 40; // length doesn't matter, it is needed to delete the key
valueName.MaximumLength = 0;
```

It is noteworthy that `NtSetValueKey()` takes a `UNICODE_STRING` as parameter, hence `valueName.Buffer` is a wide-char (wchar_t). The created key is not really hidden, but when *Regedit* tries to read it, it will  throw an error and not appear in the listing. The key cannot be exported and written to a file either and won't appear in the Startup tab of Task Manager.

Prepending *nullbytes* to a user inputted string was a little harder but I managed to work with a prefix.

```c
// < truncated for space >
char* buff = BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);
wchar_t regkeyname[100];
toWideChar(buff, regkeyname, 100);

wchar_t prefix[200] = L"xx";
wcscat(prefix, regkeyname);

UNICODE_STRING valueName;
valueName.Buffer = prefix;
// get length first, because wcslen() will stop at a nullbyte
valueName.length = wcslen(prefix) * 2;
valueName.Buffer[0] = '\0';
valueName.Buffer[1] = '\0';
```

### 4. Wrapping up

The [PeloponneseanWarKit]() is a work in progress and will take many more hours to get bug free, stable and add more functionality. I feel like I've learnt a huge amount of techniques, discovered a lot of interesting frameworks and tools and found a lot of interesting people in a short amount of time.

The great thing about developing tools is the research that goes into the inner workings of techniques and tools which we would otherwise `git clone`, build and run, or worse, download and execute. On the other hand it also tests your patience and induces headaches.

Anyways, I've got an `error: implicit declaration of function 'itsWeeknd()'` on line 311 which I need to get back to...

`NtDelayExecution(FALSE, 604800000);`
