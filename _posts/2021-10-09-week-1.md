I start the first week of my internship in true spooktober fashion as I dive into a daunting subject that's been scaring me for some time now: The Windows Kernel.
<!--more-->

### 1. KdPrint("Hello, world!\n");

When I finished my previous internship which was focused on bypassing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software and Anti-Virus (AV) software from a user land point of view, we joked around with the idea that the next topic would be defeating the same problem but from kernel land. At that point in time I had no experience at all with the Windows kernel and it all seemed very advanced and above my level of technical ability. As I write this blogpost, I have to admit it wasn't as scary or difficult as I thought it to be. C/C++ is still C/C++ and assembly instructions area still headache inducing, but comprehensible with the right resources and time dedication.

In this first post, I will layout some of the technical concepts and ideas behind the goal of this internship, as well as reflect back on my first steps in successfully bypassing/disabling a reputable Anti-Virus product, but more on that later.

### 2. BugCheck?

To set this rollercoaster in motion, I highly recommend checking out [this post](/archived/2021/05/01/week-2.html#2-okay-how-am-i-abusing-these-bofs) in which I briefly covered User Space (and Kernel Space to a certain extent) and how EDRs interact with them.

![User Space vs Kernel Space](/assets/images/windows-kernel.png)

In short, the Windows OS roughly consists of 2 layers, User Space and Kernel Space. 

User Space or user land contains the Windows Native API: `ntdll.dll`, the WIN32 subsystem: `kernel32.dll, user32.dll, advapi.dll,...` and all the user processes and applications. When applications or processes need more advanced access or control to hardware devices, memory, CPU, etc... they will use `ntdll.dll` to talk to the Windows kernel. 

The functions contained in `ntdll.dll` will load a number, called "the system service number", into the `EAX` register of the CPU and then execute the `syscall` instruction (x64-bit) which starts the transition to kernel mode while jumping to a predefined routine called the system service dispatcher. The system service dispatcher performs a lookup in the System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) using the number in the `EAX` register as an index. The code then jumps to the relevant system service and returns to user mode upon completion of execution.

Kernel Space or kernel land is the bottom layer in between User Space and the hardware and consists of a number of different elements. At the heart of Kernel Space we find `ntoskrnl.exe` or as well call it: *the kernel*. This executable houses the most critical OS code, like thread scheduling, interrupt and exception dispatching, and various kernel primitives. It also contains the different managers such as the I/O manager and memory manager. Next to the kernel itself, we find device drivers which are loadable kernel modules. I will mostly be messing around with these, since they run fully in kernel mode. Apart from the kernel itself and the various drivers, Kernel Space also houses the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), `win32k.sys` which mainly handles the User Interface (UI), and various system and subsystem processes (Lsass.exe, Winlogon.exe, Services.exe,...), but they're less relevant in relation to EDRs/AVs.

Opposed to User Space, where every process has its own virtual address space, all code running in Kernel Space shares a single common virtual address space. This means that a kernel-mode driver can overwrite or write to memory belonging to other drivers, or even the kernel itself. When this occurs and results in the driver crashing, the entire operating system will crash.

In 2005 with the first x64-bit edition of Windows XP, Microsoft introduced a new feature called [Kernel Patch Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Patch_Protection), colloquially known as PatchGuard. PatchGuard is responsible for protecting the integrity of the Window kernel, by hashing its critical structures and performing comparisons at random time intervals. When PatchGuard detects a modification, it will immediately *Bugcheck* the system (`KeBugCheck(0x109);`), resulting in the infamous Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) with the message: "CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION".

### 3. A battle on two fronts

The goal of this internship is to develop a kernel driver which will be able to disable, bypass, mislead, or otherwise hinder EDR/AV software on a target. So what exactly is a driver, and why do we need one?

As stated in the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/what-is-a-driver-), a driver is a software component that lets the operating system and a device communicate with each other. Most of us are familiar with the term "graphics card driver", we frequently need to update it to support the latest and greatest games. However, not all drivers are tied to a piece of hardware, there is a separate class of drivers called *Software Drivers*.

![software driver](/assets/images/software-driver.png)

Software drivers run in kernel mode and are used to access protected data that is only available in kernel mode, from a user mode application. To understand why we need a driver, we have to look back in time and take into consideration how EDR/AV products work or used to work. 

Obligatory disclaimer: *I am by no means an expert and a lot of the information used to write this blogpost comes from sources which may or may not be trustworthy, complete or accurate.*

EDR/AV products have adapted and evolved over time with the increased complexity of exploits and attacks. A common way to detect malicious activity is for the EDR/AV to hook the WIN32 API functions in user land and transfer execution to itself. This way when a process or application calls a WIN32 API function, it will pass through the EDR/AV so it can be inspected and either allowed, or terminated. Malware authors bypassed this hooking method by directly using the underlying Windows Native API (ntdll.dll) functions instead, leaving the WIN32 API functions mostly untouched. Naturally, the EDR/AV products adapted, and started hooking the Windows Native API functions. Malware authors have used several methods to circumvent these hooks, these include direct syscalls, unhooking and more. I recommend checking out [A tale of EDR bypass methods](https://s3cur3th1ssh1t.github.io/A-tale-of-EDR-bypass-methods/) by [@ShitSecure](https://twitter.com/ShitSecure)(S3cur3Th1sSh1t).

When the battle could no longer be fought in user land (since Windows Native API is the lowest level), it transitioned into kernel land. Instead of hooking the Native API functions, EDR/AV started patching the System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT), sounds familiar? When execution from `ntdll.dll` is transitioned to the system service dispatcher, the lookup in the SSDT will yield a memory address belonging to a EDR/AV function instead of the original system service. This practice of patching the SSDT is risky at best, because it affects the entire operating system and if something goes wrong it will result in a crash.

With the introduction of PatchGuard (KPP), Microsoft made an end to patching SSDT in x64-bit versions of Windows (x86 is unaffected) and instead introduced a new feature called **Kernel Callbacks**. A driver can register a *callback* for a certain action. When this action is performed, the driver will receive either a pre or post notification.

EDR/AV products make heavy use of these callbacks to perform their inspections. A good example would be the `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` callback. 

1. When a user application wants to spawn a new process, it will call the `CreateProcessW()` function in `kernel32.dll` which will then trigger the *create process callback*, letting the kernel know a new process is about to be created. 
2. Meanwhile the EDR/AV driver has implemented the `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` callback and assigned one of its functions (0xFA7F) to that callback.
3. The kernel registers the EDR/AV driver function address (0xFA7F) in the **callback array**.
4. The kernel receives the process creation callback from `CreateProcessW()` and sends a notification to all the registered drivers in the **callback array**.
5. The EDR/AV driver receives the process creation notification and executes its assigned function (0xFA7F).
6. The EDR/AV driver function (0xFA7F) instructs the **EDR/AV application running in user land** to inject into the **User Application**'s virtual address space and hook `ntdll.dll` to transfer execution to itself.

![kernel callback](/assets/images/kernel-callback.png)

With EDR/AV products transitioning to kernel space, malware authors had to follow suit and bring their own kernel driver to get back on equal footing. The job of the malicious driver is fairly straight forward: eliminate the kernel callbacks to the EDR/AV driver. So how can this be achieved?

1. An evil application in user space is aware we want to run [Mimikatz.exe](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), a well known tool to extract plaintext passwords, hashes, PIN codes and Kerberos tickets from memory.
2. The evil application instructs the evil driver to disable the EDR/AV product.
3. The evil driver will first locate and read the **callback array** and then patch any entries belonging to EDR/AV drivers by replacing the first instruction in their callback function (0xFA7F) with a return `RET (0xC3)` instruction.
4. Mimikatz.exe can now run and will call `ReadProcessMemory()` which will trigger a callback.
5. The kernel receives the callback and sends a notification to all the registered drivers in the **callback array**.
6. The EDR/AV driver receives the process creation notification and executes its assigned function (0xFA7F).
7. The EDR/AV driver function (0xFA7F) executes the `RET (0xC3)` instruction and immediately returns.
8. Execution resumes with `ReadProcessMemory()` which will call `NtReadVirtualMemory()` which in turn will execute the syscall and transition into kernel mode to read the `lsass.exe` process memory.

### 4. Don't reinvent the wheel

Armed with all this knowledge, I set out to put the theory into practice. I stumbled upon [Windows Kernel Ps Callback Experiments](http://blog.deniable.org/posts/windows-callbacks/) by [@fdiskyou](https://twitter.com/fdiskyou) which explains in depth how he wrote [his own evil driver](https://gitlab.com/deniable/windows-ps-callbacks-experiments) and evilcli user application to disable EDR/AV as explained above. To use the project you need [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and the latest [Windows SDK and WDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

I also setup two virtual machines configured for [remote kernel debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/attaching-to-a-virtual-machine--kernel-mode-) with [WinDbg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools)
1. Windows 10 build 19042
2. Windows 11 build 21996

With the following options enabled:

```
bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON
bcdedit /debug on
bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:2 baudrate:115200
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```

To compile and build the driver project, I had to make a few modifications. First the build target should be Debug - x64. Next I converted the current driver into a [primitive driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/creating-a-primitive-driver) by modifying the `evil.inf` file to meet the new requirements.

```

```

Once the driver compiled and got signed with a test certificate, I installed it on my Window 10 VM with WinDbg remotely attached. To see kernel debug messages in WinDbg I updated the default mask to 8 `kd> ed Kd_Default_Mask 8`.

```
sc create evil type= kernel binPath= C:\Users\Cerbersec\Desktop\driver\evil.sys
sc start evil
```

![windbg evil driver](/assets/images/windbg-evil-driver.png)

Using the `evilcli.exe` application with the `-l` flag, I can list all the registered callback routines from the callback array for process creation and thread creation. When I first tried this I immediately bluescreened with the message "Page Fault in Non-Paged Area".

### 5. The mystery of 3 bytes

This BSOD message is telling me I'm trying to access non-committed memory, which is an immediate bugcheck. The reason this happened has to do with Windows versioning and the way we find the callback array in memory.

![bsod](/assets/images/DebugOutput.png)

Locating the callback array in memory by hand is a trivial task and can be done with WinDbg or any other kernel debugger. First we disassemble the `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` function and look for the first `CALL (0xE8)` instruction.

![PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine](/assets/images/PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine.png)

Next we disassemble the `PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` function until we find a `LEA (0x4C 0x8D 0x2D)` (load effective address) instruction.

![PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine](/assets/images/PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine.png)

Then we can inspect the memory address which `LEA` puts in the `r13` register. This is the **callback array** in memory.

![callback array](/assets/images/CallbackArray.png)

To view the different drivers in the callback array, we need to perform a logical `AND` operation with the address in the callback array and `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF8`.

![logical and](/assets/images/ActualRoutines.png)

The driver roughly follows the same method to locate the callback array in memory, by calculating offsets to the instructions we looked for manually, relative to the `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` function base address, which we obtain using the `MmGetSystemRoutineAddress()` function.

```c++
ULONG64 FindPspCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()
{
	LONG OffsetAddr = 0;
	ULONG64	i = 0;
	ULONG64 pCheckArea = 0;
	UNICODE_STRING unstrFunc;

	RtlInitUnicodeString(&unstrFunc, L"PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine");
    //obtain the PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine() function base address
	pCheckArea = (ULONG64)MmGetSystemRoutineAddress(&unstrFunc);
	KdPrint(("[+] PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine is at address: %llx \n", pCheckArea));

    //loop though the base address + 20 bytes and search for the right OPCODE (instruction)
    //we're looking for 0xE8 OPCODE which is the CALL instruction
	for (i = pCheckArea; i < pCheckArea + 20; i++)
	{
		if ((*(PUCHAR)i == OPCODE_PSP[g_WindowsIndex]))
		{
			OffsetAddr = 0;

			//copy 4 bytes after CALL (0xE8) instruction, the 4 bytes contain the relative offset to the PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine() function address
			memcpy(&OffsetAddr, (PUCHAR)(i + 1), 4);
			pCheckArea = pCheckArea + (i - pCheckArea) + OffsetAddr + 5;

			break;
		}
	}

	KdPrint(("[+] PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine is at address: %llx \n", pCheckArea));
	
    //loop through the PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine base address + 0xFF bytes and search for the right OPCODES (instructions)
    //we're looking for 0x4C 0x8D 0x2D OPCODES which is the LEA, r13 instruction
	for (i = pCheckArea; i < pCheckArea + 0xff; i++)
	{
		if (*(PUCHAR)i == OPCODE_LEA_R13_1[g_WindowsIndex] && *(PUCHAR)(i + 1) == OPCODE_LEA_R13_2[g_WindowsIndex] && *(PUCHAR)(i + 2) == OPCODE_LEA_R13_3[g_WindowsIndex])
		{
			OffsetAddr = 0;

            //copy 4 bytes after LEA, r13 (0x4C 0x8D 0x2D) instruction
			memcpy(&OffsetAddr, (PUCHAR)(i + 3), 4);
            //return the relative offset to the callback array
			return OffsetAddr + 7 + i;
		}
	}

	KdPrint(("[+] Returning from CreateProcessNotifyRoutine \n"));
	return 0;
}
```

They takeaway here are the `OPCODE_*[g_WindowsIndex]` constructions, where `OPCODE_*[g_WindowsIndex]` are defined as:

```c++
UCHAR OPCODE_PSP[]	 = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xe8, 0xe8, 0xe8, 0xe8, 0xe8, 0xe8 };
//process callbacks
UCHAR OPCODE_LEA_R13_1[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4c, 0x4c, 0x4c, 0x4c, 0x4c, 0x4c };
UCHAR OPCODE_LEA_R13_2[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d };
UCHAR OPCODE_LEA_R13_3[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2d, 0x2d, 0x2d, 0x2d, 0x2d, 0x2d };
// thread callbacks
UCHAR OPCODE_LEA_RCX_1[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x48, 0x48, 0x48, 0x48, 0x48, 0x48 };
UCHAR OPCODE_LEA_RCX_2[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d, 0x8d };
UCHAR OPCODE_LEA_RCX_3[] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0d, 0x0d, 0x0d, 0x0d, 0x0d, 0x0d };
```

And `g_WindowsIndex` acts as an index based on the Windows build number of the machine (`osVersionInfo.dwBuildNumer`).

To solve the mystery of the BSOD, I compared debug output with manual calculations and found out that my driver had been looking for the `0x00` OPCODE instead of the `0xE8 (CALL)` OPCODE to obtain the base address of the `PspSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` function. The first `0x00` OPCODE it finds is located at a 3 byte offset from the `0xE8` OPCODE, resulting in an invalid offset being copied by the `memcpy()` function.

After adjusting the OPCODE array and the function responsible for calculating the index from the Windows build number, the driver worked just fine.

### 6. Driver vs Anti-Virus

To put the driver to the test, I installed it on my Windows 11 VM together with Avast Anti-Virus. After patching the Avast driver callback routines in the callback array, `mimikatz.exe` was successfully executed. When returning the Avast driver callback routines back to their original state, `mimikatz.exe` was detected and blocked upon execution.
