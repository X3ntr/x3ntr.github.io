First week of my internship and we're starting off strong. This week I play hide and seek with C2 communications and plunge into the world of Windows Internals and Cobalt Strike.

### 1. printf("Hello, World!\n");

Hello. Thanks for reading. I would introduce myself but we both now you're not really here for that, so let's get right into it.

I will be researching 2 broad topics during my 8 week internship. The end goal is to create new tooling and find new techniques to help a Red Team stay undetected in a foreign environment. The topics I will cover are:

* C2 communication channels: smuggling the goodies
* Shellcode injection using Cobalt Strike's Beacon Object Files and direct syscalls: bypassing EDR/AV

But enough with the formalities, we've got work to do.


### 2. In command, but not in control

Command & Control, also commonly referred to as C2, is the term used to denote part of an attacker's infrastructure that is responsible for handling a large number of remote sessions. 

When a target network is breached and machines compromised, the attacker needs to establish persistence, exfiltrate data, and numerous other things. On a single machine this could be achieved with just a reverse shell, but as the amount of compromised machines increases, the need for a centralized framework that can manage connections, track sessions, share sessions, create new sessions, and so on, arises.

This is where C2 framworks like [Covenant](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant), [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/), [Empire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire), [Brute Ratel](https://bruteratel.com/), [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic), [SharpC2](https://github.com/SharpC2/SharpC2) and [Merlin](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin) come into play. Once a machine is compromised, an *implant* will be executed, usually in the form of a hidden process, which will then receive commands from the attack and send back information. The server that is responsible for sending commands to all the different *implants* and processing the data it gets back, is commonly called a *Team Server*.

It speaks for itself that a team server is a critical piece of infrastructure that contains and controls a lot of sensitive data. If the team server would be discovered by defenders and blocked, the attacker would probably loose (part of) his foothold and access to the target network. To prevent this from happening, attackers use redirectors or intermediary servers in between the target network and their own infrastructure. These redirectors could be owned by the attacker, or could be legitimate infrastructure controlled by the attacker, like CDN's, DoH providers, etc.

A critical part of C2 infrastructure is the communication channel, method, medium, between the implant and the redirectors, as well as communication between implants themselves. It is imperative to hide the traffic from defenders and to make sure it doesn't get blocked by internal proxy servers or firewalls.

Common protocols used by C2 frameworks to communicate over are: HTTP(s), SMB and DNS.
Common methods to bypass filtering used by C2 frameworks are: Domain fronting, SaaS, DNS over HTTPS, DNS tunneling.

Domain Fronting is by far the most popular technique to hide C2 traffic, unfortunately it is coming to an end and CDN providers are cracking down on infrastructure abusing this technique, so it is time to find alternatives.

### 3. API stands for Attacker's Public Infrastructure

API's are great. They're public infrastructure, they're legitimate, and they're heavily used by web applications and other legitimate software running in corporate environments which makes them near impossible to block.

A relatively new C2 framework developed by [FSecure Labs](https://labs.f-secure.com/tools/c3) called [C3](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/C3) makes heavy use of public API's from Software as a Service (SaaS) providers like Google Drive, Dropbox and Slack to create C2 channels.

> C3 (Custom Command and Control) is a tool that allows Red Teams to rapidly develop and utilise esoteric command and control channels (C2). It's a framework that extends other red team tooling, such as the commercial Cobalt Strike (CS) product via ExternalC2, which is supported at release. It allows the Red Team to concern themselves only with the C2 they want to implement; relying on the robustness of C3 and the CS tooling to take care of the rest.

I set up a new C3 team server and created a channel using Google Drive and a channel using Dropbox. I integrated the C3 server with Cobalt Strike's team server and delivered a Cobalt Strike Beacon over both channels.

### 3. Wrapping up


`NtDelayExecution(FALSE, 604800000);`


### 1. During the past week, which tasks did you work on?
* C2 communucations over SaaS with [C3](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/C3) framework
* C2 communications over DNS over HTTPS with [godoh](https://github.com/sensepost/godoh) and [DoHC2](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/DoHC2)
* Writing [Beacon Object Files](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon-object-files) that leverage direct syscalls with [SysWhispers](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers) and [InlineWhispers](https://github.com/outflanknl/InlineWhispers)
