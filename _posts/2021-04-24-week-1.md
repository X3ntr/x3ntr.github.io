### 1. During the past week, which tasks did you work on?
* C2 communucations over SaaS with [C3](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/C3) framework
* C2 communications over DNS over HTTPS with [godoh](https://github.com/sensepost/godoh) and [DoHC2](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/DoHC2)
* Writing [Beacon Object Files](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon-object-files) that leverage direct syscalls with [SysWhispers](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers) and [InlineWhispers](https://github.com/outflanknl/InlineWhispers)

### 2. How much time did you spend on each task? (estimate)
* C2 over SaaS with C3 framework: 12h
* C2 over DNS over HTTPS: 12h
* Beacon Object Files: 16h

### 3. Which skills were required?
* Programming (Go, C, C++, C#, Python)
* Reverse engineering
* Knowledge of C2 frameworks
* Knowledge of API's
* Troubleshooting and debugging skills

### 4. Did you acquire these skills during your education?
For the majority of skills, not really. We have seen limited C# and Python and web API's to some extend. But most of my knowledge and experience with different languages and frameworks comes from experimenting in my own spare time and previous education.

### 5. Which difficulties did you experience?
There are a lot of advanced technical concepts that require experience and time to understand. It is easy to read documentation and deploy a framework, but it took some time to reverse engineer and understand the inner workings of the DNS over HTTPS PoC's.

The most challenging task so far is developing beacon object files. My C and C++ knowledge is rusty and lacking in some areas. It requires a lot of reading of technical documentation, blog posts, Stack Overflow, and other PoC's on GitHub to understand. There is a lot of trial and error, debugging and troubleshooting involved in the process.

### 6. Did you receive proper guidance?
Yes, I receive excellent feedback and answers to my questions. My mentors have been very helpful in providing initial sources and PoC's, providing access to infrastructure or a nudge in the right direction when I'm stuck.
