This week I try to figure out "what makes a driver a driver?" and experiment with writing my own kernel hooks.
<!--more-->

### 1. Windows Kernel Programming 101

This week I spent the vast majority of my time reading the fantastic book [Windows Kernel Programming by Pavel Yosifovich](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Kernel-Programming-Pavel-Yosifovich/dp/1977593372) which is a great introduction to the Windows kernel and it's components and mechanisms, as well as drivers and their anatomy and functions. With that said, this week's blogpost will be noticably shorter but I hope to still cover some interesting topics nonetheless.

Last week I briefly covered the concepts behind patching kernel callbacks and touched on setting up the [Windows Kernel Ps Callback Experiments](http://blog.deniable.org/posts/windows-callbacks/) project by [@fdiskyou](https://twitter.com/fdiskyou).

In this blogpost I would like to take a closer look at the anatomy of a driver and experiment with a different technique called **IRP MajorFunction hooking**.

### 2. Anatomy of a driver

Most of us are familiar with the classic C/C++ projects and their characteristics. For example the `int main(int argc, char* argv[]){ return 0; }` function, which is the typical entry point of a C++ console application. So what makes a driver a driver?

Just like a C++ console application, a driver requires an entry point as well. This entry point comes in the form of a `DriverEntry()` function with the prototype:

```c++
NTSTATUS DriverEntry(_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath);
```

The `DriverEntry()` function is responsible for 2 major tasks:
1. setting up the driver's `DeviceObject` and associated *symbolic link*
2. setting up the dispatch routines

Every driver needs an *"endpoint"* which other applications can use to communicate with the driver. This comes in the form of a `DeviceObject`, an instance of the `DEVICE_OBJECT` structure. The `DeviceObject` is abstracted in the form of a *symbolic link* and registered in the **Object Manager**'s `??` directory (use [sysinternal's WinObj](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/winobj) tool to view the Object Manager). User mode applications can use functions like `NtCreateFile` with the symbolic link as a handle, to talk to the driver.

Example of a C++ application using `CreateFile` to talk to a driver registered as "Interceptor" (hint: it's my driver ;) ):

```c++
HANDLE hDevice = CreateFile(L"\\\\.\\Interceptor)", GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_READ, 0, nullptr, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, nullptr);
```

Once the driver's endpoint is configured, the `DriverEntry()` function needs to sort out what to do with incoming communications from user mode and other operations such as unloading itself. To do this, it uses the `DriverObject` to register **Dispatch Routines**, or functions associated with a particular driver *operation*.

The `DriverObject` contains an array, holding function pointers, called the **MajorFunction** array. This array determines which particular operations are supported by the driver, such as Create, Read, Write, etc... The index of the **MajorFunction** array is controlled by *Major Function codes*, defined by their **IRP_MJ_** prefix.

There are 3 main Major Function codes along side the `DriverUnload` operation which need initializing for the driver to function properly:

```c++
// prototypes
void InterceptUnload(PDRIVER_OBJECT);
NTSTATUS InterceptCreateClose(PDEVICE_OBJECT, PIRP);
NTSTATUS InterceptDeviceControl(PDEVICE_OBJECT, PIRP);

//DriverEntry
extern "C" NTSTATUS
DriverEntry(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath) {
    DriverObject->DriverUnload = InterceptUnload;
    DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE] = InterceptCreateClose;
    DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CLOSE] =  InterceptCreateClose;
    DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL] = InterceptDeviceControl;

    //...
}
```

The `DriverObject->DriverUnload` dispatch routine is responsible for cleaning up and preventing any memory leaks before the driver unloads, a leak in the kernel will persist until the machine is rebooted. The `IRP_MJ_CREATE` and `IRP_MJ_CLOSE` Major Functions handle `CreateFile()` and `CloseHandle()` calls, without them handles to the driver wouldn't be able to be created or destroyed, so in a way the driver would be unusable. Finally, the `IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL` Major Function is in charge of I/O operations/communications.

A typical driver communicates by receiving requests, handling those requests or forwarding them to the appropriate device in the *device stack* (out of scope for this blogpost). These requests come in the form of an **I/O Request Packet** or **IRP**, which is a semi-documented structure, accompanied by one or more **IO_STACK_LOCATION** structures located in memory directly following the IRP. Each IO_STACK_LOCATION is related to a device in the *device stack*, the driver can call the `IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation()` function to retrieve the IO_STACK_LOCATION related to itself.

The previously mentioned dispatch routines determine how these IRPs are handled by the driver. We are interested in the **IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL** dispatch routine, which corresponds to the `DeviceIoControl()` call from user mode or `ZwDeviceIoControlFile()` call from kernel mode. An IRP request destined for IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL contains two user buffers, one for reading and one for writing, as well as a control code indicated by the `IOCTL_` prefix. These control codes are defined by the driver developer and indicate the supported actions.

Control codes are build using the `CTL_CODE` macro, defined as: 

```c++
#define CTL_CODE(DeviceType, Function, Method, Access)((DeviceType) << 16 | ((Access) << 14) | ((Function) << 2) | (Method))
```

Example for my Interceptor driver:

```c++
#define IOCTL_INTERCEPTOR_HOOK_DRIVER CTL_CODE(0x8000, 0x800, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
#define IOCTL_INTERCEPTOR_UNHOOK_DRIVER CTL_CODE(0x8000, 0x801, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
#define IOCTL_INTERCEPTOR_LIST_DRIVERS CTL_CODE(0x8000, 0x802, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
#define IOCTL_INTERCEPTOR_UNHOOK_ALL_DRIVERS CTL_CODE(0x8000, 0x803, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
```

### 3. Kernel land hooks

Now that we have a vague idea how drivers communicate with other drivers and applications, we can think about ways to intercept those communications. One of these techniques is called **IRP MajorFunction hooking**.

![hook MFA](/assets/images/hook-mfa.png)

Since drivers and all other kernel processes share the same memory, we can also access and overwrite that memory as long as we don't upset PatchGuard by modifying critical structures. I wrote a driver called *Interceptor*, which does exactly that, it locates the target driver's `DriverObject` and retrieves its MajorFunction array (MFA). This is done using the undocumented `ObReferenceObjectByName()` function which uses the driver device name to get a pointer to the `DriverObject`.

```c++
UNICODE_STRING targetDriverName = RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(L"\\Driver\\Disk");
PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject = nullptr;

status = ObReferenceObjectByName(
	&targetDriverName,
	OBJ_CASE_INSENSITIVE,
	nullptr,
	0,
	*IoDriverObjectType,
	KernelMode,
	nullptr,
	(PVOID*)&DriverObject
);

if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
	KdPrint((DRIVER_PREFIX "failed to obtain DriverObject (0x%08X)\n", status));
	return status;
}
```

Once it has obtained the MFA, it will iterate over all the Dispatch Routines (IRP_MJ_*) and replace the pointers, which are pointing to the target driver's functions (0x1000 - 0x1003), with my own pointers, pointing to the *InterceptHook* functions (0x2000 - 0x2003) controlled by the *Interceptor* driver.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < IRP_MJ_MAXIMUM_FUNCTION; i++) {
    //save the original pointer in case we need to restore it later
	globals.originalDispatchFunctionArray[i] = DriverObject->MajorFunction[i];
    //replace the pointer with our own pointer
	DriverObject->MajorFunction[i] = &GenericHook;
}
//cleanup
ObDereferenceObject(DriverObject);
```

As an example I hooked the disk driver's IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL dispatch routine and intercepted the calls:

![Hooked IRP Disk Driver](/assets/images/hooked-irp-disk-driver.png)

This method can be used to intercept communications to any driver but is fairly easy to detect. A driver controlled by EDR/AV could iterate over its own MajorFunction array and check the function pointer's address to see if it is located in its own address range. If the function pointer is located outside its own address range, that means the dispatch routine was hooked.
